* Diane's Guix Overlay

A collection of custom Guix packages that are either unsuitable for
submission upstream or I haven't gotten around to it yet.

* Usage

Point Guix toward the root of the source tree

#+BEGIN_SRC: shell
export GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=$(pwd)
#+END_SRC

The packages in this repo will take precedence over those in the
official distribution.
